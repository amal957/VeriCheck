📰 VeriCheck-Fake News Detection System

🌟 Project Overview

The Fake News Detection System is a machine learning-powered web application designed to identify and classify fake news articles. 
This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, particularly the TF-IDF Vectorizer, to transform text data and various classification algorithms to predict whether a given news article is Real or Fake.

🚀 Features

🌐 Web Interface: A user-friendly web interface built using Streamlit, enabling users to input news headlines or articles for analysis.

🧠 Machine Learning Models:

XGBoost Classifier: Achieved an accuracy of 96.22%

Passive Aggressive Classifier: Achieved an accuracy of 95.47%

📊 Performance Metrics: Evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

📄 Pre-trained Models: Utilizes models saved in .pkl files for quick predictions.

📚 Dataset: Trained on the WELFake dataset containing over 45,000 articles.

📂 Dataset

The dataset used is the WELFake dataset, containing over 45,000 articles labeled as Real or Fake. The data includes various features such as:

Title
Text content
Label (Real or Fake)


🛠️ How It Works

Text Preprocessing:

Removal of URLs, special characters, and digits.

Conversion to lowercase.

Removal of English stopwords using NLTK.

Feature Extraction:

Uses TF-IDF Vectorizer to transform text data into numerical features.

Model Training:

The dataset was split into training and testing sets.

Multiple classifiers were trained and evaluated for optimal performance.

Prediction:

Users can input news articles via the web interface to get predictions on whether the news is Real or Fake.

📈 Usage
Upload a news article or enter the headline in the input box.

Click on the "Analyze" button.

The model will predict whether the news is Real or Fake.
